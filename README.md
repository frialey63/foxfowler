My 'A' Level Computer Science project of 1981 from Ashmole School, Southgate.

## METHOD

Starting from a faded listing in a dusty box in my loft...

1 Adobe Scan app on Android

2 OCR by Windows "Text Extractor" PowerToy

3 GNU F77 compiler and make

4 Microsoft VS Code

## TODO

- rationalise labels as either GOTO locations (000) or read/write FORMATS (400/500)
- more subroutines and functions!
